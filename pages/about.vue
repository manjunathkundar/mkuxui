          As a Product designer, I have discovered an endless curiosity for what
          makes a design great and what makes that flow…well, flow. Whether
          you're a company of one, twenty, or in the hundreds, I am all about
          the individual experience and am devoted to designing impactful,
          memorable and efficient user-centric experiences.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-6 md:mt-8">
          I did my Master(MCA) from Sikkim Manipal University, India. I loved
          the human-centered design methods and processes in this 13+years of my
          professional carreer and applied them in projects.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-6 md:mt-8">
          I grew up in city called Manipal which is a education hub in India and
          my ability to quickly adjust to new challenges in life comes from
          that. Owing to my diverse upbringing, I embrace all cultures and try
          to bring it to the designs I create. I am a movie buff and there’s
          nothing like relaxing to a good masala Bollywood movie. Food is my
          second love and I let my nose guide me to the pleasures of the stomach
          once every weekend.
