          where I designed for some of its core offerings like Incorporation,
          Payroll, Registry with a global reach that helped integrate all their
          needs under one roof. Having led the design phase for one year in this
          young, rapidly growing enterprise startup environment - taught me how
          to balance business goals and engineering constraints as I
          unrelentingly advocated for the user.

          with a degree in Bachelor of Computer Application. I loved the

          I grew up in Manipal which is a education hub in India and my ability
          to quickly adjust to new challenges in life comes from that. Owing to
          my diverse upbringing, I embrace all cultures and try to bring it to
          the designs I create. I am a movie buff and there’s nothing like
          relaxing to a good masala Bollywood movie. Food is my second love and
          I let my nose guide me to the pleasures of the stomach once every
          weekend.
