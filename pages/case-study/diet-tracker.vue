              The Problem

            <p class="mt-8">
              Obesity is a growing concern in the world now, unhealthy food and
              sleep schedule, insufficient exercises due to lack of time and
              many other factors all causes obesity to be one of the major
              health concern nowadays.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-8">
              When people start working out, much of their success or failure in
              reaching their goals are based on their diet. Even with a great
              plan, tracking your eating after every meal is very hard, and good
              UX can be an important factor in your success or failure in the
              long run. I found this as an interesting challenge to solve.

              At the discovery phase of my project, I conducted user interviews

            <p class="mt-8">
              I started interviewing the people who are at the age group of 45+.
              I was very much curious to know are they in the need of these kind
              of application or not.

            <p class="mt-8">
              I interviewed 6 patients are of 45+ age and 2 patients are of age

            <p class="mt-8">
              The main insights I got from the interview, people tend to forget
              Intake rather than medicines. Maintaining a healthy diet was very
              important for them. This made me change my thought where I just
              concentrated on medicate based app. I had to introduce diet and
              exercise tracker for this.

              As a designer, we are often lured by attractive, trendy and out of
              the box designs. But, We must always remember the ‘why’. The
              primary goal is to understand the user, their problems and then
              come up with a design that solves it.

              The trouble with most of us is that we would rather be ruined by
