            <p class="mt-8">
              Account Exective(AE) from Emerhub had a practice to collect and
              manage data from clients under multiple tools like Google form,
              Excel, Airtable and Drive.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-8">
              The goal was to build a Digital platform which could make the
              client to submit their needs without the assistance of Emerhub and
              AE can then ask extra details and provide requiered service from
              the platform itself. It is also into notify user on regular basis
              of the incorporation progress and reminder to submit mandatory
              document and also maintain it for future reference.

              The first part of the research was to understand how AE
              strategize, create and execute their plans. For this, I conducted
              interviews with product managers and AE. This allowed me to
              understand their work, their process and to identify the pain
              points they encounter on a daily basis.

              much as I could from the AE to understand the challenges they face

              pain areas.
