              The Problem
            </h2>
            <p class="mt-8">
              The traditional hiring process is often a one-way “conversation”
              between the recruiter, Candidate and client. This is achieved by
              some calls and F2F interviews. While all still important, the
              biggest change has happened to the way, i.e. remote position.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-8">
              Today, 40% of the employee work from remote. Like many other
              companies, Emerhub struggles to give its client a platform that
              can not only help them in finding the right candidate but also
              maintain their employees Compensation, Invoices, Leaves and other
              payroll related documents.
